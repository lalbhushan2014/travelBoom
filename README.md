# travelBoom

It includes a navigation bar with links to the homepage, “About Us,” and “Contact Us” pages. You will create a search bar allowing users to input destinations or keywords to search for recommendations.

A simple app containing a search feature in which in the header if you search by beaches,then it shows all beaches, if temples then temples and if by a city name then the data enters the data based on the countries data.

Here I haven't used fetch and rather have taken the json data in a variable and then called and filter in the javascript method.

Please check it and let me know. I believ is someone asks me to call an api and then generate the data that can be done too easily..

Thanks
